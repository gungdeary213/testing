# Property Price Prediction with Polynomial Regression

## Overview
This project implements polynomial regression models to predict property prices based on various features. The implementation includes comprehensive data analysis, model training, evaluation, and regularization analysis.

## Features
- Synthetic property data generation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Polynomial regression with degrees 1-5
- Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Feature importance analysis
- Best model selection and prediction
